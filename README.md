The idea behind the repositoryu is to collaboratively develop the Flat Earth setting, including
the bestiary and world maps, as well as propose, develop, and store adventure concepts.

```{admonition} No real-time support for standalone edge node Microvisor installation.

After the OS is installed, they are deployed on a writable section of the filesystem.
Image and orchestration system updates are not enabled natively, at the moment.
